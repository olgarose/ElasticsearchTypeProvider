# Elasticsearch Type Provider

Elasticsearch Type Provider simplifies F# access to Elasticsearch. It ships with F# friendly types (wrapping Nest Query DSL) and generates domain types (F# records) based on Elasticsearch metadata.

Please note that this is work in progress and I plan on improving setup, so that it does not require connecting to Twitter to get simple example working. Meanwhile, feel free to follow [Getting started tutorial](http://olgarose.github.io/ElasticsearchTypeProvider/index.html#Getting-started)
